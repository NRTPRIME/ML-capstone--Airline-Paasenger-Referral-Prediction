Project Name - Airline Paasenger Referral Prediction
Project Type - Classification
Contribution - Individual
Project Summary -
The "Airline Passenger Referral Prediction" project aims to develop a classification model that predicts whether a passenger will refer the airline to others based on their travel experience. The prediction will be binary, indicating whether a passenger is likely to recommend the airline (positive class) or not (negative class).

Objective:

The primary goal is to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty by identifying passengers who are more likely to refer the airline to others. By understanding the factors influencing positive referrals, the airline can tailor its services to meet customer expectations and improve overall passenger experience.

Dataset:

The project will utilize a dataset containing historical information about airline passengers, including details such as flight preferences, on-board services usage, customer feedback, and previous referral behavior. The dataset will be split into training and testing sets to develop and evaluate the predictive model.

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning and handling missing data.
Feature engineering to extract relevant information.
Encoding categorical variables.
Scaling numerical features if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understanding the distribution of key features.
Exploring correlations between features and referral behavior.
Identifying patterns and trends in the data.
Feature Selection:

Selecting the most relevant features for model training.
Eliminating redundant or irrelevant features.
Model Selection:

Choosing classification algorithms suitable for the problem.
Training multiple models and evaluating their performance.
Model Training:

Utilizing the training dataset to teach the model to recognize patterns in the data.
Fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Model Evaluation:

Assessing the model's performance on the testing dataset. Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve.
Interpretability:

Analyzing feature importance to understand which factors contribute most to passenger referral predictions.
Providing insights into actionable improvements based on the model's findings.
Deployment:

Integrating the trained model into the airline's operational systems for real-time predictions.
Implementing a feedback loop to continuously update and improve the model.
Benefits:

Improved understanding of factors influencing passenger referrals.
Targeted strategies for enhancing services based on predictive insights.
Increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Efficient allocation of resources to areas that most impact passenger experience.
Challenges:

Handling imbalanced classes in the referral prediction.
Ensuring the model's interpretability for effective decision-making.
Adapting to changing customer preferences and market dynamics.

Problem Statement
Airlines face challenges in understanding and predicting factors influencing passenger referrals. This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify passengers likely to recommend the airline, addressing issues such as inefficient resource allocation, high customer acquisition costs, and the need for a competitive advantage. The objective is to enhance customer satisfaction, optimize resource allocation, and leverage positive word-of-mouth referrals for improved operational efficiency and market competitiveness.
